How to make your own ...... from Part B?
	If I want to make my own 7-segment display, I will need 4 switches and 4 LEDs since it's 4-bit binary. First, I will label the switches from In[0] to In[3] and the LEDs from OUT[0] to OUT[3]. Then all you need to do is flipping the switches and look for the coresponding LEDs. For example, if I want to get 9, I would flip on IN[3] and IN[0] and that would give me 1001, which is 9.

How do you think the random number generator works?
	Maybe inside the generator there are a bunch of switches, when you hit the button, it will just flip on some switches and generates a "random" binary number.

How can things be really ramdon in a computer......?
	I don't think things can be really random in a computer. Maybe the computer will generate a bunch of number sequences at a time and choose to display some of them "randomly". To us, these sequences might look like random because we only get to see parts of the whole thing.
